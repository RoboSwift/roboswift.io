Welcome to **RoboSwift**!

[Swift](https://swift.org/) is a very promising language that many hope will replace other scripting languages like Python or Ruby. A year ago the language was made open source. Since then it has been ported to many different platforms, and there is hope that many people will learn it as a first language to build anything they can think of.

In this site we will explore the language through small projects in the field of robotics, automation, general DIY and electronics. [Physical computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing) is a great way to learn and explore programming and engineering. We'll build small projects that any maker can attempt at home, with only two requirements: Has to be fun, and it needs to use Swift as much as possible.

Updates will be coming soon!
